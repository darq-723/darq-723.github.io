        <h2>Logs:</h2>
        <p><b>January 16, 2021:</b><br> I just made this log in Sublime text 3!<br> I can't believe how easy this was but VS Code is still my top 1.<br> I'll be sleeping now, Goodnight.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>January 12, 2021:</b><br> I just realized that i've been doing the wrong way of adding path variables, I'm really retarded lol.<br> I'm back to business again on coding.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>December 22, 2020:</b><br> It's been 4 days since I last logged in here, sorry cause I was busy attending mass and I really didn't had time to code.<br> But anyways, I actually installed LoL again because I'm bored and I need to pass time.<br> That is why I installed it.<br> Right now I'm planning to return to Eclipse again because It's faster than Intellij IDEA and it doesn't use that much RAM so it's a great decision.<br> Java is kinda hard tho, no cap.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>December 18, 2020:</b><br> As of right now, I am working on my exams so I could relax.<br> </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>December 17, 2020:</b><br> Now I know what the basics of node.js, I'm planning to make another website.<br> I'm still working on the design that I'll make, I plan to be a front-end developer because making websites look good is like heaven to me.<br> I hope that I could study in great Software-Engineering Colleges one day so that I could make money out of my hobby so that I could live peacefully.<br> just found out that I have Obsessive Color Disorder, just kidding.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>December 16, 2020:</b><br> Right now I'm working on my server that I'm making using node.js and it's working well.<br> I'm still figuring out on how to have a custom domain to make my websites look cool.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>December 15, 2020:</b><br> Just realized that the latest version of Node.js isn't compatible with Windows 7 (the OS that I'm using right now), so I was forced to use an older version of it.<br> Not gonna lie, Node.js is actually pretty good.<br> It can open .js files without a browser and you can even make a local server using node.js, it was very cool.<br> I guess I'll just have to wait then.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>December 13, 2020:</b><br> I never knew that Javascript has some hard syntax and it looks like Java.<br> I always liked these languages, because it looks cool to me.<br> Maybe that's just me I guess, Idk.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>December 12, 2020:</b><br> I now made a login system using javascript!<br> I'm very happy that it fucking worked.<br> I don't know what to say.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>December 10, 2020:</b><br> Hey it's me again! This time I'm thinking about Node.js, I found out about it in the internet.<br> It is a Javascript Framework and I've taken quite a liking to it.<br> I hope that I could make great projects in the future so I could live a peaceful life.<br> Also, I will not reach my dreams so I could have a reason to enjoy life, because if you reach your dreams then what.<br> Nothing but pure boredom.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>December 8, 2020:</b><br> Hi I'm Dion G. Arquisola and this is my first log.<br> It seems that I now know how to make websites with HTML and CSS.<br> If that's the case, I will move forward with either JS or Python.<br> I think I'll become a Full-Stack Developer because I'm interested in Node.Js and Django Python. </p>
