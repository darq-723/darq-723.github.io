So cool... if she doesn't have that trait then, I kinda... like her I guess? maybe it's just the Oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin acting up in my body I guess, idk, Skye was the only few person who was kind to me, So I guess I developed a crush on her, because of her kindness and uhhhhh s-she's k-kinda cute. But, I mean, Why am I thinking of her when I know she's not thinking of me?")
